# Credit-risk
This project aims to develop an integrated data analytics system utilizing
Python and its libraries, along with Polymer, to perform comprehensive analyses on
a real-world consumer loan dataset, leading to actionable business insights.

Following the CRISP-DM methodology, the project begins with a thorough
understanding of the business context and objectives. Subsequently, the datasets
provided—a labeled dataset with over one million rows and 28 attributes (including
the target variable) and an unlabeled dataset for predictive analysis—are explored to
identify potential challenges, risks, and opportunities.

Data preprocessing techniques, including outlier detection, missing value imputation,
and feature engineering, are applied to ensure data quality.
The project leverages Python and Pandas for data manipulation, descriptive
statistics, and exploratory data analysis.

Various modeling techniques, including descriptive, explanatory, and predictive
analyses, are employed to uncover patterns, trends, and relationships within the
data.

Machine learning algorithms are utilized for predictive modeling, forecasting, and
classification tasks, providing actionable insights for credit risk management.
